# Swirl-Flow-around-a-Cylinder
It is a CFD project of determining Laminar and Swirl flow at different regions using COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS simulation Software which solves the Navier Strokes Partial Differential Equation and gives us the 
results like (2D/3D)Velocity and Contour Profile, Pressure Profile, Azimuthal Velocity profile etc.

In this model we need to lock the pressure to a reference value in a point. The reason for this is that the model does not contain any boundary condition where the pressure is specified (this is often done at 
outlets). Also the fluid density is constant, which means that the pressure level is not coupled to the density. In this model, set the pressure to zero in the top-right corner.

The comsole file is too big to upload,that's why a comsole file without results is being uploaded. To see the results and for detailed analysis
